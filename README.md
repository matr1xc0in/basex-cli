# basex-cli
A JavaScript cli tool to encode/decode baseX (e.g. base58)

* node should be installed
* npm should be installed

*Limitation*: Only do Base 58 for now. Your help is appreciated. If you notice
other repo already done this, please let me know. I don't like reinventing wheels.

# How to use

```
npm install
```

```
node basex-cli.js 58 QmdpMvUptHuGysVn6mj69K53EhitFd2LzeHCmHrHasHjVX
```
